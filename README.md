# PlayBoy-and-PlayGirl-detector

Since the early 17th to mid 19th centuries, the term “playboy” and “playgirl” were brought into existence with the initial definition of boy actor and girl actor respectively. As time goes, these terms slowly deviate to carry a whole different meaning which is what we currently recognize as “players” in respect to the dating field. They solely date or flirt with other people to seek pleasure having zero intention of commitment.

PlayBoy-and-PlayGirl-detector is a chatbot-based system that detects player based on the replies received from them. Before you start chatting with them, let the chatbot takes over and the system will predict the probability of them being a player. After that, you can decide on your own whether to continue conversation with them. It saves your time in chatting with those people who do not take love relationship seriously.

Tinder is the platform used in this project.
